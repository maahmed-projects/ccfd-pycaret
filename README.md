# What is PyCaret?
PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. 
It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that exponentially speeds up the experiment cycle and makes you more productive.

Compared with the other open-source machine learning libraries, PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can replace hundreds of lines of code with a few lines only. This makes experiments exponentially faster and more efficient. PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, spaCy, Optuna, Hyperopt, Ray, and a few more

# Modules in PyCaret
PyCaret’s API is arranged in modules. Each module supports a type of supervised learning (**classification** and **regression**) or unsupervised learning (**clustering, anomaly detection, nlp, association rules mining**). A new module for time series forecasting was released recently under beta as a separate pip package.

# Installing PyCaret
Installing PyCaret is simple through pip and it takes only a few minutes. PyCaret's default installation only installs hard dependencies as listed in the requirements.txt file on the repo.

``pip install pycaret``

## To install the full version:
``pip install pycaret[full]``

# Features
PyCaret’s claim to fame is its simplicity. Compared to other automated machine learning softwares, PyCaret is extremely flexible, comes with a unified API, and has no learning curve. 

PyCaret is loaded with functionalities. You can go from processing your data to training models, and then deploying them on the cloud within a few lines of code. It comes with a lot of preprocessing transformations that are applied automatically when the experiment is initialized. The model zoo of PyCaret has over 70 untrained models for supervised and unsupervised tasks.
